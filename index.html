I‘ve been bringing my parents here for annual checkups for more than a decade. Overall process can be made more efficient (for example moving patients from one checkup to another) but it is kind of offset as there is plenty of staff who are friendly and quick to help.</p></div>

    <div class="four"><h4 align="center">Why I’m a Cardiofeminist
    </h4><br><p>A gynaecardiologist means a cardiologist for women. I want better cardiovascular healthcare for females, but I also want a better position for female cardiologists. In the U.S. and many other countries the position of a female cardiologist is still very inferior compared to the male. I know that female cardiologists are more interested in the subject of female patients and healthcare for women, but they don’t get the positions in which they may be able to make the change. It’s a very macho culture still. In the Netherlands, it is difficult for my female colleagues to get a good position in a hospital, when they are not in the core group and earn less; they have to do the work and the men will be on the stage and earning the money. This is another issue of course, but I am the pain in the arse of the Dutch society of cardiology! <br><br>In the Netherlands around 75% of medical students are women, but what we hear from the female students here and in other countries is that the atmosphere that cardiology departments have, the macho behaviour that is still hanging around, means that they don’t want to work there for the rest of their lives. Women still have to be fighters to get in and to survive, and it is not very easy for women to persist in a career in cardiology. In the U.S. less than 10% of new cardiologists are women because the culture of cardiology isn’t very attractive still. </p></div>
<div class="four"><h4 align="center">Heart-Healthy  Goals</h4><br><p>2020 was hard for everyone—physically, emotionally and mentally. As we ring in the new year and welcome 2021 with open arms, it’s time to establish some “new year, new me” healthy habits. From losing weight, reducing stress, quitting smoking or exercising more, these goals can all help with your heart health, which is extremely important amidst the pandemic. The experts at AMS Cardiology are getting to the heart of the matter and sharing some heart-healthy new year’s resolutions and foods that you can incorporate into your daily routine.
    Lose Weight <br><br>Chances are in 2020, you put on a little weight. Quarantine, lack of exercise and social engagement and overeating are to blame. While losing weight is often the number one new year’s resolution for many, it’s the first one that people tend to break. To keep you on track, start by setting a more realistic goal for the first part of the new year. Getting to your ideal weight can be challenging but shedding as few as 7 to 10 pounds can decrease your risk of: <br><br>
     <ul>
         <li>Heart disease</li>
         <li>Stroke</li>
         <li>Diabetes</li>
         <li>High cholesterol</li>
         <li>  Hypertension </li>
     </ul>
     <br>If you plan to shed those stubborn extra pounds in 2021, some heart-healthy foods you can incorporate into your diet include: <br><br>
     <ul>
         <li>Dark, leafy green vegetables</li>
         <li>Whole grains</li>
         <li> Berries</li>
         <li>Avocados</li>
         <li>Fatty fish and fish oil</li>
         <li>Legumes</li>
         <li>Dark chocolate</li>
         <li>Nuts and seeds</li>
     </ul>

<div class="four"><h4 align="center">Visit the Dentist with Confidence During COVID-19</h4><br><p>Attitudes about returning to the dentist during the pandemic continue to vary, according to the United Kingdom’s General Dental Council (GDC). According to its latest survey, 61% of people feel just as confident about visiting the dentist as they did before the pandemic, while 32% feel less safe. <br><br>

    During the lockdown, which began on March 23, only urgent or emergency dental care was available via regional hubs and centers. A third of respondents said they had an appointment cancelled or postponed during this first stage. Dental practices began to reopen on June 8 in England, June 22 in Scotland and Wales, and June 29 in Northern Ireland. <br><br>
    
    Of the 23% of respondents who reported experiencing pain or other dental problems during the lockdown, 51% preferred to wait for the lockdown to end before seeking treatment or wait for the issue to go away, as they felt it wasn’t urgent. Also, 35% sought professional help, while 14% decided to self-treat. <br><br>
    
    Most of those surveyed were aware that only urgent services were available during the lockdown, but 30% did not know. Patients were most likely to seek this type of information directly from their dental practice, but many people aren’t registered with a practice. <br><br>
    
    This suggests a need for the public and patients to have clear communication about services and treatments that are available, particularly as the pandemic continues and restrictions start to change rapidly across the UK, the GDC said. <br><br>
    
    Patients also were most likely to say that they would continue to seek care for fillings, root canal work, extractions and implants, checkups, and treatment for gum conditions. But about a quarter of those polled said they would be a lot less likely to get cosmetic dentistry or non-dental treatments such as face fillers.

<div class="four"><h4 align="center">I Brush My Teeth Twice A Day, So Why Do I Still Get Cavities?
</h4><br><p>Many people have been trying to form better habits while they stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic including eating healthier, working out more, self-reflecting, and more. However, I still have plenty of patients that come in and ask…
 <br><br>I brush my teeth twice a day, so why do I still get cavities? <br><br>
 While the answer to this question is different for everyone, there are still some general principles about cavity formation that I share with my patients that can help address this concern: <br><br>
<ul>
    <li> How do cavities form?</li>
    <li> How can you help your teeth re-mineralize?</li>
    <li>When is the best time of day to brush your teeth?</li>
    <li>How Do Cavities Form?</li>
</ul><br><br>All our teeth are made up of minerals. Any time you eat or drink sugary or starchy foods, bacteria in the plaque on your teeth begin to produce acid, then this acid eats away at the enamel (or the protective layer on your teeth). When your mouth drops below a critical pH and becomes more acidic, teeth begin to lose those natural minerals on our teeth. <br><br> It takes about 30-60 minutes after eating or drinking for the pH in your mouth to return to normal. However, if you don’t give your mouth enough time to recover after eating or drinking and consume something else high in sugars or starch, the process begins all over again and acid continues to form from the plaque on your teeth.
<br><br>For example, drinking a can of soda in 10 minutes is much better than sipping it over the course of an hour because your mouth will only be exposed to this acidic beverage for 10 minutes rather than repeatedly for 60 minutes. The sooner your teeth can start the re-mineralizing process, the better.Saliva is our friend! Saliva is a big help in keeping our teeth protected. It acts as a natural buffer from harmful particles and helps flush them out. The same minerals found in our teeth are also present in saliva, so after you eat, saliva helps add calcium and phosphate back to the teeth.

<div class="four"><h4 align="center">Can Drinking Water Improve Your Acne</h4><br><p>water is the most important drink we can consume. Given that 60% of the human body is made up of water, it’s clear to see that water plays an important role in keeping our bodies healthy and hydrated. <br><br>Studies suggest that you cannot live without water beyond 21 days and that dehydration causes exhaustion, fatigue and reduction of bodily functions quickly. You can survive without water for 3 days, however how your body acts and how you experience this time will be significantly different to bodies and minds that are well hydrated.
 <br><br>This emphasises the power water has to stimulate and support our body. It’s not only an important component of our body in general but a key ingredient in keeping our bodies in the best condition we can throughout our lifetimes. <br><br>
 THE BENEFITS OF DRINKING WATER ON THE BODY: <br><br>
 Drinking water has many benefits both on the body as a whole, as well as your skin specifically. The benefits of drinking water on the body in general include: <br>Water Helps Deliver Oxygen Around the Body
 <br><br>With blood cells consisting of 80% water, the importance of good hydration cannot be disregarded. Blood is a tool used by the body to carry oxygen throughout the body. Therefore, staying hydrated through water consumption helps to ensure blood cells carry effective amounts of oxygen across the body.Water Helps to Maintain Blood Pressure <br><br>If blood cells are lacking in water, the blood becomes thicker, which increases blood pressure in the body. Normalising blood pressure is super important because if the pressure is incorrect, the blood might not flow correctly around the circulatory system and no oxygen or nutrients would be delivered through our arteries to the tissues and organs.</p></div>
<div class="four"><h4 align="center">Dermatologist Recommended Acne Treatments</h4><br><p>Depending on how your body develops, you may find that even at 40+ years of age, breakouts of acne may occur due to your body changing during this period of your life.
 <br><br>Acne is the result of hereditary genetics, but also hormonal changes, menstruation and can also be brought on by bouts of stress. Some foods are considered to irritate acne, causing breakouts, so it’s extremely important to manage your diet as much as it is to keep a healthy skincare routine. <br><br>Throughout the history of medicine, dermatologists and pharmaceutical companies have studied acne to help try and identify how to prevent the cause of acne and treat/eradicate this skin condition. Unfortunately, while there are many various attempts at preventing, managing and treating acne, there is no golden arrow for everyone. <br><br>Acne is a skin condition that has to be treated on an individual basis, which is why acne treatments vary depending on the course of treatment your dermatologist has prescribed for you. This will be bespoke to you based on the type of acne you have and the required treatment, the location of the acne, whether the acne is scarring or pimpled. Alongside this, they will consider your skin type and how dry/oily this might be.
 <br><br>There are standard practices for acne treatments that will be followed. Naturally, this may range from the type of acne medication that is recommended, whether a hormonal digestive or a lotion cream for the skin or in cases of extreme scarring; chemical peeling and/or laser acne treatments.
